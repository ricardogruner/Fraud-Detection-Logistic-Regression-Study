# Fraud-Detection-Logistic-Regression-Study
I did a few Logistic Regression rounds to study how different approaches change the model's performance.
There's also some EDA, including data visualizations.
The dataset I used here is a popular one, found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
In addition to functioning as a practice exercise, this notebook also documents my workflow.
